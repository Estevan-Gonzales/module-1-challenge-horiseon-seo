# Module 1 Challenge - Horiseon SEO

## Description

This application is my solution to the Module 1 Challenge of the Coding Bootcamp.
This application was refactored to provide samantic additions for accessibility.
Accessability is necessary and important for users that may have a hard time understanding traditionally written code.
Through this project, I learned how to provide accessible written code through a variety of means.
